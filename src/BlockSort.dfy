  Verified Block Sort in Dafny

  This module contains a verified implementation of block sort in the programming language Dafny.
  This implementation is not in place! The ressource <https://every-algorithm.github.io/2023/11/27/block_sort.html>
  was used for the implementation. Instead of creating a new array for every merge a single array is used.

  I expect, without having done an analysis:
    
  | worst-case performance      | O(n log n) |
  | --------------------------- | ---------- |
  | worst-case space complexity | O(n/2)     |

    method Merge<A(!new, ==)>(leq: (A, A) -> bool, a: array<A>, lo: nat, mid: nat, hi: nat, cache: array<A>)
      modifies a
      modifies cache
      requires TotalOrdering(leq)
      requires lo < mid < hi <= a.Length
      requires SortedBy(leq, a[lo..mid])
      requires SortedBy(leq, a[mid..hi])
      requires a.Length <= cache.Length
      ensures SortedBy(leq, a[lo..hi])
    // ensures multiset(a[lo..hi]) == multiset(old(a[lo..hi]))
