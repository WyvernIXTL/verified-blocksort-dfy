  Verified Block Sort in Dafny

  This module contains a verified implementation of block sort in the programming language Dafny.
  This implementation is not in place! The ressource <https://every-algorithm.github.io/2023/11/27/block_sort.html>
  was used for the implementation. Instead of creating a new array for every merge a single array is used.

  I expect, without having done an analysis:
    
  | worst-case performance      | O(n log n) |
  | --------------------------- | ---------- |
  | worst-case space complexity | O(n/2)     |
